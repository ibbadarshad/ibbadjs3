            A mobile phone (also known as a hand phone, cell phone, or cellular telephone[1]) is a
            small portable radio telephone.

            The mobile phone can be used to communicate over long distances without wires. It works by
            communicating with a nearby base station (also called a "cell site") which connects it to the main phone
            network.
            This is called a "hand off," and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to. The
            hand-off is done
            so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another
            cell.

            As mobile phones became more popular, they began to cost less money, and more people could afford them.
            Monthly plans became available for rates as low as US$30 or US$40 a month.
            Cell phones have become so cheap to own that they have mostly replaced pay phones and phone booths except
            for urban areas with many people.

            In the 21st century, a new type of mobile phone, called smartphones, have become popular.
